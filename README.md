# Octoly front-end test
This simple repo has been created using `create-react-app`.
Clone, `yarn`, `yarn start` and start coding!
The test should take between 10 and 45 minutes.

### Objective 1:
When a campaign row is clicked, it should be highlighted, and the right part of the screen should display campaign details (use component `CampaignDetails`).

### Objective 2:
- Campaigns #2 and #4 have a note, it should be displayed in the sidebar when selected
- The `Note` section of the sidebar should be editable.
- The `Clear` button should empty the note
- When selecting another campaign, the current text should be properly replaced by the new campaign note

## Keep in mind:
- All the UI is already done! you should be dealing only with logic and state management
- Feel free to use any library you're comfortable with
